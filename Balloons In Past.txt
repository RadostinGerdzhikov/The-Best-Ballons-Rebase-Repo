On December 1, 1783, just ten days after the first hot air balloon ride, the first gas 
balloon was launched by physicist Jacques Alexander Charles and Nicholas Louis Robert.  
This flight too started in Paris, France.  The flight lasted 2½ hours and covered a 
distance of 25 miles.  The gas used in the balloon was hydrogen, a lighter than air gas 
that had been developed by an Englishman, Henry Cavendish in 1999, by using a 
combination of sulphuric acid and iron filings.

Gas balloons soon became the preferred mode of air travel.  The balloon shown at left is 
the Royal Vauxhall Balloon typical of gas balloons which were flown in the 1830’s and 
1840’s.  Unlike hot air balloons, gas balloons did not depend upon fire to get them 
aloft and stay up and therefore they were able to stay up longer and their altitude 
could be controlled somewhat easier with the use of ballasts. Gas balloons continued to 
be the primary mode of air travel until the invention of the fixed wing aircraft  by the 
Wright brothers in America in 1903. However, it was expensive to and time consuming to 
inflate a gas balloon so flying was not something just anyone could afford.  Hot air 
balloons, however, had no dependable heat source, so hot air ballooning was not very 
practical.
